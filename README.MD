# CS-300 Data Structures

_What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?_

ABC University is looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students. This code will require us to import data from a text file and store it in a data structure. Before the course is saved, the information will be validated to ensure that each course has a course number and a course title. When the courses are displayed back to the user, they must print out in alphanumerical order from least to greatest along with it's prerequisites if applicable. The user also must be abe to search for a course by course number.

_How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand._

I approached this problem by pseudocoding the solution to this problem using a vector, hash table, and a binary search tree. Then, I ran a runtime analysis on each of these pseudocodes to see which data structure would provide the fasted runtime and lowest total memory cost. I found that the binary search tree would be the most efficient way to ordered and display the data properly. It was important for me to understand how to create all of these data structures in order to do an accurate runtime analysis.

_How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?_

I did a lot of googling and YouTube tutorials on both the concepts of these data structures and how to implement them efficiently in C++.

_How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?_

Yes, it has made me more thorough in my approach. This is my first experience with going line by line to determine a runtime analysis and I saw how beneficial that was for the end product.

_How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable_

My work has resulted in me taking scalability into consideration much more than I used to. I also expanded my ability to use different data structures to maximize their advantages and learned how to write more effective and clear psuedocode to guide my code.
